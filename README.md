# High-peformance
My name is Nandini Yadav Gudala, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Health Data Science. I have a strong passion for research, particularly in areas where data-driven insights can make a meaningful impact on healthcare. Outside academics, I enjoy playing basketball, which helps me stay active and focused, and I love exploring my creativity through cooking. Reading books is another hobby that allows me to broaden my perspectives and unwind. These interests, combined with my dedication to learning, reflect my multifaceted personality and drive for excellence.
